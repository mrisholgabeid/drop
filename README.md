The website you are looking at is a test sample of my main site which is available here: https://menetcorp.com/cmalt.

# the site available on the link provided uses the previous design I created 2 years ago. this new website design was created 4 days ago.

# I NEED HELP WITH THE FOLLOWING:
- I would like to create better dropdown menus (currently marked as Core Area [1, 2, and 3]).
- I would like the dropdown to remain open when a link is click.
- The dropdown should close on when I select its relevant main dropdown link or open a different dropdown. (example: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started)
